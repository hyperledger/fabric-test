Scenario Outline: <jira_num>: CouchDB Indexing, <language> with 3 channels and 3 index with 1 selector
    Given I have a bootstrapped fabric network of type kafka using state-database couchdb without tls
    When a user defines a couchDB index named index_behave_test_1 with design document name "indexdoc_behave_test_1" containing the fields "owner" to the chaincode at path "<index_path>"
    And a user defines a couchDB index named index_behave_test_2 with design document name "indexdoc_behave_test_2" containing the fields "docType" to the chaincode at path "<index_path>"
    And a user defines a couchDB index named index_behave_test_3 with design document name "indexdoc_behave_test_3" containing the fields "color" to the chaincode at path "<index_path>"
