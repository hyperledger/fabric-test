Feature: Bootstrapping Hyperledger Fabric
    As a user I want to be able to bootstrap my fabric network

Scenario Outline: FAB-3856: Verify crypto material (non-TLS) generated by cryptogen
    Given I have a crypto config file with <numOrgs> orgs, <peersPerOrg> peers, <numOrderers> orderers, and <numUsers> users
    When the crypto material is generated
    Then crypto directories are generated containing certificates for <numOrgs> orgs, <peersPerOrg> peers, <numOrderers> orderers, and <numUsers> users
    Examples:
       | numOrgs | peersPerOrg | numOrderers | numUsers |
       |    2    |      2      |      3      |     1    |
       |    3    |      2      |      3      |     3    |
       |    2    |      3      |      4      |     4    |
       |    10   |      5      |      1      |     10   |

Scenario: Setting of environment variables
    Given the KAFKA_DEFAULT_REPLICATION_FACTOR environment variable is 1
    And the CONFIGTX_ORDERER_BATCHTIMEOUT environment variable is 10 minutes
    And the CONFIGTX_ORDERER_BATCHSIZE_MAXMESSAGECOUNT environment variable is 10
    And the FABRIC_LOGGING_SPEC environment variable is gossip.discovery=DEBUG:nodeCmd=DEBUG
    And I have a bootstrapped fabric network of type kafka with tls
    Then the KAFKA_DEFAULT_REPLICATION_FACTOR environment variable is 1 on node "kafka1"
    And the CONFIGTX_ORDERER_BATCHTIMEOUT environment variable is 10 minutes on node "orderer0.example.com"
    And the CONFIGTX_ORDERER_BATCHSIZE_MAXMESSAGECOUNT environment variable is 10 on node "orderer1.example.com"
    And the ORDERER_GENERAL_TLS_ENABLED environment variable is true on node "orderer2.example.com"
    And the CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED environment variable is true on node "peer0.org1.example.com"
    And the FABRIC_LOGGING_SPEC environment variable is gossip.discovery=DEBUG:nodeCmd=DEBUG on node "peer1.org2.example.com"
    And the logs on peer1.org2.example.com contains "\[gossip.discovery\] periodicalSendAlive -> DEBU" within 5 seconds
    And the logs on peer1.org2.example.com contains "\[nodeCmd\] serve -> DEBU" within 5 seconds
