Feature: Fabric-CA Service
    As a user I want to be able to use the Fabric-CA for generation of certificates

#@doNotDecompose
@interop
#@daily
Scenario Outline: FAB-6489: Interop using <type> orderer, <database>, <interface>, <language> chaincode
    # We should be able to turn TLS on for these tests once CLI certificates and JavaSDK TLS is working correctly - FAB-15018
    #Given I have a bootstrapped fabric network of type <type> using state-database <database> with tls
    Given I have a bootstrapped fabric network of type <type> using state-database <database>
    And I use the <interface> interface
    And I enroll the following users using fabric-ca
         | username  |   organization   | password |  role  | certType |
         |  latitia  | org1.example.com |  h3ll0   | admin  |   x509   |
         |   scott   | org2.example.com |  th3r3   |  user  |   x509   |
         |   adnan   | org1.example.com |  wh@tsup |  user  |   x509   |
    When an admin sets up a channel
    And an admin deploys chaincode at path "<path>" with args ["init","a","1000","b","2000"] with name "mycc" with language "<language>"
    And I wait "5" seconds
    When a user "adnan" queries on the chaincode with args ["query","a"]
    Then a user receives a success response of 1000
    When a user "scott" queries on the chaincode with args ["query","a"] from "peer0.org2.example.com"
    Then a user receives a success response of 1000 from "peer0.org2.example.com"
    When a user "adnan" invokes on the chaincode with args ["invoke","a","b","10"]
    And I wait "5" seconds
    When a user "scott" queries on the chaincode with args ["query","a"] from "peer0.org2.example.com"
    Then a user receives a success response of 990 from "peer0.org2.example.com"
    When a user "scott" invokes on the chaincode named "mycc" with args ["invoke","a","b","10"] on "peer0.org2.example.com"
    And I wait "5" seconds
    When a user "latitia" queries on the chaincode with args ["query","a"]
    Then a user receives a success response of 980
Examples:
    | type  | database | interface  |                          path                     | language |
