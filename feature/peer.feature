Scenario Outline: FAB-3505: Test chaincode example02 deploy, invoke, and query, with <type> orderer
    Given I have a bootstrapped fabric network of type <type>
    When a user sets up a channel
    And a user deploys chaincode at path "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go/chaincode_example02" with args ["init","a","1000","b","2000"] with name "mycc"
    When a user queries on the chaincode named "mycc" with args ["query","a"]
    Then a user receives a success response of 1000
    When a user invokes on the chaincode named "mycc" with args ["invoke","a","b","10"]
    And I wait "5" seconds
    And a user queries on the chaincode named "mycc" with args ["query","a"]
    Then a user receives a success response of 990

    When "peer0.org2.example.com" is taken down
    And a user invokes on the chaincode named "mycc" with args ["invoke","a","b","10"]
    And I wait "5" seconds
    And "peer0.org2.example.com" comes back up
    And I wait "10" seconds
    And a user queries on the chaincode named "mycc" with args ["query","a"] on "peer0.org2.example.com"
    Then a user receives a success response of 980 from "peer0.org2.example.com"
Examples:
    | type  |
    | solo  |
    | kafka |

Scenario Outline: FAB-1440, FAB-3861: Basic Chaincode Execution - <type> orderer type, using <database>, <security>
    Given I have a bootstrapped fabric network of type <type> using state-database <database> <security>
    When a user sets up a channel
    And a user deploys chaincode
    When a user queries on the chaincode
    Then a user receives a success response of 100
    When a user invokes on the chaincode
    And I wait "5" seconds
    And a user queries on the chaincode
    Then a user receives a success response of 95
Examples:
    | type  | database |  security   |
    | solo  | leveldb  |  with tls   |
    | solo  | leveldb  | without tls |
    | solo  | couchdb  |  with tls   |
    | solo  | couchdb  | without tls |
    | kafka | leveldb  |  with tls   |
    | kafka | leveldb  | without tls |
    | kafka | couchdb  |  with tls   |
    | kafka | couchdb  | without tls |

Scenario Outline: FAB-3865: Multiple Channels Per Peer, with <type> orderer
    Given I have a bootstrapped fabric network of type <type>
    When a user sets up a channel named "chn1"
    And a user deploys chaincode at path "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go/chaincode_example02" with args ["init", "a", "1000" , "b", "2000"] with name "cc1" on channel "chn1"
    When a user sets up a channel named "chn2"
    And a user deploys chaincode at path "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go/map" with args ["init"] with name "cc2" on channel "chn2"
    When a user invokes on the channel "chn2" using chaincode named "cc2" with args ["put", "a", "1000"]
    And I wait "5" seconds
    And a user queries on the channel "chn2" using chaincode named "cc2" with args ["get", "a"]
    # the "map" chaincode adds quotes around the result
    Then a user receives a success response of "1000"
    When a user invokes on the channel "chn2" using chaincode named "cc2" with args ["put", "b", "2000"]
    And I wait "5" seconds
    And a user queries on the channel "chn2" using chaincode named "cc2" with args ["get", "b"]
    # the "map" chaincode adds quotes around the result
    Then a user receives a success response of "2000"
