Scenario Outline: FAB-3505: chaincode example02 deploy invoke query with <type> orderer <database> db <security>
    Given I have a bootstrapped fabric network of type <type> using state-database <database> <security>
    And I use the <interface> interface
    When an admin sets up a channel
    And an admin deploys chaincode at path "../../fabric-test/chaincodes/example02/go/cmd" with args ["init","a","1000","b","2000"] with name "mycc"
    When a user queries on the chaincode named "mycc" with args ["query","a"]
    Then a user receives a success response of 1000
    When a user invokes on the chaincode named "mycc" with args ["invoke","a","b","10"]
    And I wait "5" seconds
    And a user queries on the chaincode named "mycc" with args ["query","a"]
    Then a user receives a success response of 990
    When "peer0.org2.example.com" is taken down
    And a user invokes on the chaincode named "mycc" with args ["invoke","a","b","10"]
    And I wait "5" seconds
    And "peer0.org2.example.com" comes back up
    And I wait "10" seconds
    And a user queries on the chaincode named "mycc" with args ["query","a"] on "peer0.org2.example.com"
    Then a user receives a success response of 980 from "peer0.org2.example.com"
Examples:
    | type  | database |   security  |  interface |
#   | solo  | leveldb  | without tls | NodeJS SDK |
#   | kafka | couchdb  |   with tls  | NodeJS SDK |
#   | solo  | couchdb  | without tls |     CLI    |
#   | kafka | leveldb  | without tls |     CLI    |
    | solo  | leveldb  | without tls |     CLI    |
    | kafka | couchdb  |   with tls  | NodeJS SDK |

Scenario: FAB-6333: A peer with chaincode container disconnects, comes back up OK
  Given I have a bootstrapped fabric network of type solo
  When an admin sets up a channel
  And an admin deploys chaincode at path "../../fabric-test/chaincodes/example02/go/cmd" with args ["init","a","1000","b","2000"] with name "mycc"
  And I wait "10" seconds

  # do 1 set of invoke-query on peer1.org1
  When a user invokes on the chaincode named "mycc" with args ["invoke","a","b","10"] on "peer1.org1.example.com"
  And I wait "5" seconds
  And a user queries on the chaincode named "mycc" with args ["query","a"] on "peer1.org1.example.com"
  Then a user receives a success response of 990 from "peer1.org1.example.com"

  ## Now disconnect a peer
  When "peer1.org1.example.com" is taken down by doing a disconnect
  And I wait "15" seconds

  # do 2 set of invoke-query on peer0.org1
  When a user invokes on the chaincode named "mycc" with args ["invoke","a","b","20"] on "peer0.org1.example.com"
  And I wait "5" seconds
  And a user queries on the chaincode named "mycc" with args ["query","a"] on "peer0.org1.example.com"
  Then a user receives a success response of 970 from "peer0.org1.example.com"

  When a user invokes on the chaincode named "mycc" with args ["invoke","a","b","30"] on "peer0.org1.example.com"
  And I wait "5" seconds
  And a user queries on the chaincode named "mycc" with args ["query","a"] on "peer0.org1.example.com"
  Then a user receives a success response of 940 from "peer0.org1.example.com"

  #bring back up the disconnected peer
  When "peer1.org1.example.com" comes back up by doing a connect
  And I wait "30" seconds

  And a user queries on the chaincode named "mycc" with args ["query","a"] on "peer1.org1.example.com"
  Then a user receives a success response of 940 from "peer1.org1.example.com"

  When a user invokes on the chaincode named "mycc" with args ["invoke","a","b","40"] on "peer1.org1.example.com"
  And I wait "5" seconds
  And a user queries on the chaincode named "mycc" with args ["query","a"] on "peer1.org1.example.com"
  Then a user receives a success response of 900 from "peer1.org1.example.com"
