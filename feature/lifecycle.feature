Feature: Lifecycle Service
    As a user I want to be able to the new chaincode lifecycle

##@daily
Scenario Outline: FAB-13701: Test new chaincode lifecycle - Basic workflow using <interface> with <language> chaincode
  Given I changed the "Application" capability to version "V2_0"
  And I have a bootstrapped fabric network of type solo using state-database <database>
  And I use the <interface> interface
  And I want to use the new chaincode lifecycle
  When an admin sets up a channel
  And an admin packages chaincode at path "<path>" written in "<language>"
  And the organization admins install the chaincode package on all peers
  Then a packageId is received on all peers
  When each organization admin approves the chaincode package with policy "OR ('org1.example.com.member','org2.example.com.member')"
  And an admin commits the chaincode package to the channel
  And I wait up to "10" seconds for the chaincode to be committed

  When a user invokes on the chaincode with args ["init","a","1000","b","2000"] on both orgs
  And I wait up to "30" seconds for deploy to complete
  When a user queries on the chaincode with args ["query","a"]
  Then a user receives a success response of 1000
  When a user invokes on the chaincode with args ["invoke","a","b","10"]
  And I wait "5" seconds
  When a user queries on the chaincode with args ["query","a"]
  Then a user receives a success response of 990
Examples:
    | database | interface  |                          path                       | language |
    |  leveldb |   CLI      |   ../../fabric-test/chaincodes/example02/go/cmd     |  GOLANG  |

    # Once the FAB-13979 and FAB-13980 are complete for new lifecycle these should pass.
