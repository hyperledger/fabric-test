## Fabric-Test Go Tooling

The `gotools` directory is used simply to version the Go installable tools that are installed
when running the `make gotools` command from the root of the fabric-test repo.

New tools can be added, or existing tools updated by following the standard Go modules
procedures using the core Fabric repo.
