# Hyperledger Fabric PTE Connection Profile Converter

This is a Node.js script for converting a [Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric) blockchain network's connection profile(s) to a JSON configuration file in a format compatible with Fabric's [Performance Traffic Engine (PTE)](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-test/tree/main/tools/PTE).

## Prerequisites

* Ensure you have [Go](https://golang.org/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine and that the `fabric-test` repository is cloned into `$GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger/`.

## Usage and Details

The command to run the script is:
```
node <path to>/convert.js <input dir> [<output dir>]
```
`<path to>` is the path to the Node.js script, `<input dir>` is the path to the directory where your connection profile JSON files are located, and `[<output dir>]` is an optional parameter to specify a directory for the script to output the PTE configuration file.
If an output directory is not specified, then the script will default to saving the PTE configuration file in the same directory as the script.

The name of the output file is **`pte-config.json`**.

Note that if the input or output path begins with `/` they are treated as absolute;
if it begins with `~/` then they are treated as relative to your `$HOME` directory;
otherwise, the script treats the paths as relative to your _working directory_ (and _not_ relative to the script itself).

The script takes in a single network's connection profile(s) (it is possible that one network may have multiple connection profiles) and converts them to a single PTE configuration file for that network.
It is important to note that the script expects that _all_ of the JSON files in the supplied input directory are connection profiles associated with a single network, so ensure that there are no other JSON files in that directory (the script will safely skip any non-JSON files it finds).

Also, it is possible that your connection profiles contain an organization's admin certificate but not its private key.
In these cases, the PTE configuration file will still generate a private key field and set it to `'<could not read from connection profiles, please insert your private key manually>'`.
As stated, you would then have to fill out that field manually with that organization's private key.
